# Matlab/Octave codes for functional data clustering and segmentation with the mixture of regressions with hidden logistic processes (MixRHLP) model: 

<< Note that the codes are also provided in R and Python >>

developed and written by Faicel Chamroukhi


When using this code please cite the following papers : The two first ones concern the model and its use in clusterng and the last ones concern the model and its use in discrimination.

The script to run is: main_MixFRHLP.m The main function is MixFRHLP_EM.m for the EM algorithm (respectively MixFRHLP_CEM.m for the CEM-like algorithm)
